# Etch-A-Scetch

This is my second JavaScript project created for the [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/).


## Notes

These are my notes as I work through creating the project.

- Have a very rough working Etch-A-Sketch. Need to add a way for the user to be able to select the grid size and choose a color.

- The EAS is now working with a slider to change the grid size and a working color selector. Need to add an eraser 

- Game is now fully working. Added an eraser, a rainbow effect and a clear all button. Need to style the page now so it looks nice.
